# Random Forest Classification for Cross-Validation Across Studies

This repository contains the code for the manuscript: **"Lupus and inflammatory bowel disease share a common set of microbiome features distinct from other autoimmune disorders"**. The primary focus of this code is to perform Random Forest classification with cross-validation to identify distinct microbiome features shared between Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and distinguish them from other autoimmune disorders.
